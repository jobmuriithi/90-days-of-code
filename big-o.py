#Big-O gives us a way of describing how the amount of work grows as the input gets larger.

#O(1) - Constant time

students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]

print(students[0])

#O(n) - Linear time

numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

for number in numbers:
    print(number)


#O(n^2) - Quadratic time

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for  x in numbers:
    for y in numbers:
        print(x, y)



#O(log n) - Logarithmic Time
